This is the final project of The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum which presents the task of building a game of Chess that is playable from the command line.

The prompts for this project are intentionally sparse, this forces my utilisation of all resources available to me in order to tackle the problems that will inevitably arise. The rationale behind this is to mimic building a project in a work environement, albeit at a far smaller scale, where it is up to the developer to figure out a solution without relying heavily on others.
